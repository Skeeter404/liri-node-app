Liri is a text based application that takes user input from the command line in order to run different functions.
To run the application, in your terminal type out "node .\liri.js" followed by the specific action that you want. 
The different choices are as follows:
 *"spotify-this-song": will give back info about a song that you enter.
 *"concert-this": gives back information about upcoming events for whatever musician you enter.
 *"movie-this": gives info about a specific movie that you enter.
 *"do-what-it-says": which upon running, will automatically give info about a pre-selected song from spotify. 

Following your action request, type in whatever you would like to search for... i.e song, musician, or movie.
If you don't do this, a pre-selected input will be run for you.

a full command would appear as follows:
"node .\liri.js spotify-this-song radioactive" 
or
"node .\liri.js movie-this lord of the rings"
etc.

HAVE FUN!
